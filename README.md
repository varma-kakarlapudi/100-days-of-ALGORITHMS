# 100-days-of-ALGORITHMS
implementing 1 algorithm a day.


@ DAY 1  :
LINEAR SEARCH :

        It is one of the easiest searching algorithm .it can be implemented either by RECURSION ot by ITERATION.
        here we just traverse an array data structure in order to find a KEY  element ,to know whether 
        the element (KEY) is present in that array or not .

@ DAY 2 :
BINARY SEARCH :

        It is one of the searching technique which is used on a regularly basis by many programmers.
        This searching technique takes less time when compared to LINEAR search program .
        This program can be implemented using recursion .
  ##  ------> for this search technique the array on which we perform searching should be sorted .

@ DAY 3 :
JUMP SEARCH :
 
       It is another searching technique whose timecomplexity is almost similar to BINARY SEARCH . 
       Here in this search we jump from 2 to  4 then 8 then 16 and then 32 and so on .. 
       so that the no of elements we search will decrease by a greater extent whencompared to LINEAR SEARCH .
  ##  ------> for this search technique the array on which we perform searching should be sorted .

@ DAY 4 :
PRIME USING SEIVE METHOD :
 
        It takes an Array of Size N and removes all the multiples of 2,3 ans so on .. and then finallay ,
        printing the other elements  which are not visited .
   This method is used to REDUCE the time taken by normal Primes program .

@ DAY 5 :
BUBBLE SORT :

        It is one of the easiest Sorting algorithm which just completes in O(n^2) time .
        There are various algorithms which can do this same work in less time ..lets discuss them on later days.

 @ DAY 6 :
 
 STRING REDUCTION :
 
        Here we'll have to remove the letters when the i and (i+1)th  index have same ascii values .
        from this we can learn how to remove elements froma string either modifying the same string or 
        editing substring printing the substring ..
        you can refer the Text-file in Day 6 folder for detailed understanding..!!
        
 @ Day 7 :
 
 Knapsack :
 
        Knapsack is a kind of Bag . 
        Here we try to maximize the Profit by addings the elements into the bag .
        finally we have to print the profit earned .
        
        method 2 : we can do this problem using Vectors in c++ STL.

# 100-days-of-ALGORITHMS
impleenting 1 algorithm a day.


@ DAY 1  :
LINEAR SEARCH :

        It is one of the easiest searching algorithm .it can be implemented either by RECURSION ot by ITERATION.
        here we just traverse an array data structure in order to find a KEY  element ,to know whether the element (KEY) 
        is present in that array or not .

@ DAY2 :
BINARY SEARCH :

        It is one of the searching technique which is used on a regularly basis by many programmers. this searching technique takes less           time when compared to LINEAR search program .This program can be implemented using recursion .
         ##  ------> for this searching technique the array on which we perform searching is should be sorted .
